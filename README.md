# Hands-On Machine Learning - Deep Learning Solutions

 This repository contains solutions to the exercises from Part 2 (Deep Learning) of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (3rd Edition) by Aurélien Géron. The exercises focus on various Deep Learning techniques and applications, providing hands-on experience with neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders, GANs, and more.

# Repository Structure

* Chapter Folders

Each chapter is organized into a separate folder. Inside each folder, you will find:

*   Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): Step-by-step solutions to the exercises.

*   Python Scripts (.py): Standalone scripts for key implementations.
